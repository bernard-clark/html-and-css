    <h3>The Origin of The Railway Series</h3>
    <p>Wilbert Awdry who was a Reverand at a church had always been fond of locomotives in his childhood. He would think that when an engine blew steam that it was talking. Such as an engine struggling up a slope, "I can't do it", while the engine helping it, "I will do it". He came up with thhe idea of the first stories in 1942. His son Christopher had measles and couldn't leave his bed. To cure his bordome Wilbert and his wife Margarett told him nursury rhymes. All but one lost its entertainment value, which was "Down By The Station". To make it more entertaining Wilbert drew a picture of a few engines lined up with different expressions to match the nursery rhyme. The engine that appealed to Christopher the most was a sad-faced engine, who seemed to share a similar emotion to him. When he asked the engine's name, the first name to come to Wilbert's mind was Edward. After several questions and answers, the story of "Edward's Day Out" was formed. Soon, Christopher asked his father for more stories, which is where Wilbert came up with the stories "Edward and Gordon" and "The Sad Story of Henry", with the latter one being inspired from a nursery rhyme he was fond of. Christopher would often ask his father to retell the stories, which led Wilbert to write them down on the back of old church circulars. With the help of his wife, his mother, and their connections, Wilbert was able to get the book published by May 12, 1945. The name of this book was called "The Three Railway Engines". The two things that slowed down the publishing of the book were a missing fourth story and the lack of rough sketches to base the characters on. The fourth story that Wilbert wrote for the book was called "Edward, Gordon, and Henry".</p>

    <h3>The Continuation of The Railway Series</h2>
    <p>Back in 1942, after the stories for the book, "The Three Railway Engines", were written, Wilbert had made a model of a blue tank engine and given it to his son Christopher. This engine's name was Thomas, and this led to Christopherasking his father for stories about the engine. These stories were published in "Thomas The Tank Engine", in 1946, which would become known as Wilbert's second and most famous book. After the book was completed, he kept writing to keep up with popular demand until 1972. At that point, The Railway Series had a number of twenty-six books. Christopher later on took over for his father and added sixteen more books to the series. The last book in the series, "Thomas and His Friends", was published in 2011 to commemorate Wilbert's century. The Railway Series was later on overshadowed by the television series.</p>
